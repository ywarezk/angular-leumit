## Async JS

In this lesson we will improve our toolset used for dealing with async programming in JS. 
We will learn about Reactive X and compare it with Promises.

### Lesson Plan

- Difficulties writing async code
- creating Promise
- Creating Observable
- listening to promise
- listening to observable
- promise VS Observable: lazy/eager
- multiple listeners
- promise chaining
- closing an observable
- tearDownFunction
- Operators
- Subject
- Dealing with errors
- From promise to observable
- Summary what to choose

#### Student EX.

- The goal of this exercise is to try and use as many operators as you can from this list of common operators. 
- combineLatest, merge, concat, from, of, throwError, catchError, filter, debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged, map, mergeMap, pluck, tap, delay, finalize
- for each one of the operators, try to use them and see what the result of each operator is
- It might be easier to try the operator with Subject
